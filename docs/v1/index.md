# V1 API
Supported devices:
- P1 meter
- Energy socket
- Water meter (only if connected via USB)
- kWh meter

All of these devices are implemented in `homewizard4j`, but the energy socket and kWh meter are not tested on real devices.
They _should_ work, but if you have encountered a bug or error,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/Thijzert123/homewizard4j/issues).
